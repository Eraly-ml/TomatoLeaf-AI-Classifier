TomatoLeaf Diagnostics is a machine learning project focused on image classification to automatically detect diseases in tomato leaves. This tool is designed to help farmers and agronomists quickly diagnose plant diseases, enabling timely interventions to protect crops. The project is built using the FastAI library and focuses on analyzing images of tomato leaves to classify them by disease type or as  **"healthy."**

## 🎯 Project Goal
The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately identify various tomato leaf diseases, including:

Bacterial spot 🦠
Early blight 🍂
Late blight 🌱
Leaf mold 🍃
Septoria leaf spot 🍂
Spider mites 🕷️
Target spot 🎯
The model will classify images of tomato leaves into disease categories or as "healthy."

# Technologies and Libraries
This project is built using the following technologies and libraries:

**Python**: The primary programming language.
**FastAI**: A deep learning library that simplifies working with neural networks and image classification tasks.
**PyTorch**: The underlying framework for creating and training machine learning models.
**Google Colab**: A cloud platform used for running code with GPU acceleration, enabling faster model training.
